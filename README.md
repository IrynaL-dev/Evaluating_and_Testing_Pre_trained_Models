**Task 1: Create a Classifier Using VGG16**

**What is VGG16?**

It is a pre-trained model that has already been trained on a large dataset (ImageNet). It can recognize objects in images.

You can use it as a base for your own model to avoid training a model from scratch.

**What needs to be done?**

1. Load the VGG16 model without the top layers (they are needed for classification, but we will add our own).
2. Add your own layers for classification (e.g., fully connected layers).
3. Train the model on your data.

**Task 2: Test the ResNet50 and VGG16 Models on the Test Dataset**

**What is ResNet50?**

It is another pre-trained model, similar to VGG16 but with a different architecture. It has also been trained on ImageNet.

**What needs to be done?**

1. Create two models: one based on VGG16 and the other based on ResNet50.
2. Test both models on the test dataset (this is data that the model has never seen during training).

3. **Task 3: Report on Model Performance**

**What is model performance?**

It is the accuracy with which the model correctly classifies images in the test dataset.

For example, if the accuracy is 0.95, it means the model correctly classified 95% of the images.

**What needs to be done?**

1. Compare the accuracy of VGG16 and ResNet50.
2. Write which model performs better.

3. **Task 4: Create Predictions**

**What are predictions?**

These are the results that the model returns for new images (for example, which class an image belongs to).

**What needs to be done?**

Use the model to predict the classes of images from the test dataset.

**Summary**

1. Create two models: one based on VGG16 and the other based on ResNet50.
2. Train them on your data.
3. Test them on the test dataset and compare their accuracy.
4. Make predictions for the test images.
